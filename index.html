                Chauncey Creek Lobster Pier has been in owner Ron Spinney's family
                since the late 1930's when his great uncle, lobsterman Herb Witham built
                the pier to stack traps and sell gas and oil to local fisherman. 
                When Witham's son-in-law George Spinney returned home from the war, 
                he noticed some locals were asking if they'd cook Herb's lobster for them on the pier. 
                He installed boilers in the shack and tanks on the pier, and soon after 
                customers were asking if they could eat the lobster there as well. George
                laid out a few picnic tables, and what became know as Herb Witham's Lobster Pier was born.
